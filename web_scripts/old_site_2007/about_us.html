    <td width="470"><p>5west.  5west.  Oh, my.  When I was first asked to write this, well ... I was a bit overwhelmed.  I mean, trying to describe 5west is a bit like trying to describe the Taj Mahal using only the words &quot;bacon,&quot;  &quot;profligate,&quot; and &quot;David Bowie.&quot;  Quite the challenge.  But the website had to be completed, and I'd be abandoning my duty as a 5wester if I turned it down, so this is the end result.</p>
      <p>So what is 5west?  Basically, 5west is a place where people live.  That sounds obvious, but it means a bit more than it sounds like it does.  This isn't just where people leave their stuff.  People really live here.  They cook their meals, watch television, play video games, do their homework, and they do them all here.  The people who live here are fantastic, and we really encourage people to spend time on the hall and get to know us.</p>
      <p>The thing that really always struck me about 5west is it's openness.  Let me tell you, we have all types here.  We've got hackers, we've got bookworms, we've got people who study Russian, we've got varsity basketball players, we've got musicians, we've got theater geeks, we've got course 6 folk, we've got course 14 folk (we've even got a course 14 guy who does computer programming), we've got cat people, we've got dog people, and a whole lot else.  </p>

    <td><p>You can do almost anything you want here.  Want to put dry ice in soda bottles and explode them outside the window?  Great, we do that!  Want to climb into a shopping cart and ride it down ramps under Ames St.?  We do that too.  Want to build a hydraulic remote-controlled door for your dorm room?  It can happen here.  Want to be on a mystery hunt team where you can work on whatever puzzles you like?  We've got one.  As long as the music isn't face-meltingly loud after people go to sleep and you don't walk around naked, whatever you like to do, you can probably do it here.</p>
    <p>The reputation we usually get around East Campus is that we're the &quot;jock hall.&quot;  This isn't really true, more myth than reality, but as with most myths, it is based in truth.  The truth behind the myth is that 5west participates avidly in East Campus intramural sports.  This isn't to say we're very good at these sports (I know I'm not), but we play them because it gives us a chance to go out and have a good time with each other and people from other halls.  I never enjoyed sports much before I got here, but EC IM sports -- often spearheaded by 5west -- is one of the best experiences I've had here at MIT.  And IM sports is just one example of the things we like to do together.</p></td>

    <td height="339" valign="top"><p>The rules here are pretty simple.  We allow cats -- hell, we love cats.  No smoking, anywhere on the hall.  Other than that, we just try to encourage people to be respectable to each other.  Oh, and murders are very strongly discouraged.  Too much paperwork.</p>
      <p>Well, that's 5west in a nutshell.  A very wordy, somewhat cheesy nutshell, but a nutshell.  Like I said, 5west isn't something that easy to express in words.  Even if one of the words is &quot;David Bowie&quot;.  But I've lived here my whole undergraduate life, and there's no where else I'd rather be. </p>
