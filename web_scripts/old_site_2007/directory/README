Resident Database Design Information

We are using MySQL + PHP3 + Apache. PHP3 is nice-- it allows us to do some really slick things very, very easily. 

Here is the table that we are using.
+----------------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

Most of the fields are pretty obvious. A couple notes though:

*****
keys:
id, login should be keys. Name may not necessarily be a key (two people *can* have the same name). 

*****
status: This is the permission level of a user:

0: unapproved. They do not appear in the main listing
1: approved. An ordinary user, who appears in the listings
2: blessed. A superuser who can edit/modify other users settings and configure the database.

*****
Watchdog: Watchdogging is for "problem" users who like to abuse the database by entering bogus information. If you "watchdog" them, everytime they make a change to their information, they get bumped back down to "unapproved" level and an email is sent to the administrators.

*****
Privacy Level: Some users have expressed concern over having personal information included in the database. Since the whole idea of the database is to achieve a very high percentage of participation, users can select a privacy level. Only two levels are currently supported because it's a pain in the butt.

Note that some users objected to displaying lastmodificationip to the world, hence now this information is only visible to administrators.

0: Globally visible. Anyone, anywhere, can see their information.
1: Visible only to registered users. Only other registered users of the database may see their information.
2: (Not implemented) Only administrators can see their information.
