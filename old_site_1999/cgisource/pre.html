You can sort the list by any of the fields by clicking on the field name (e.g., click on "Year" to sort by their year.) <P>

The room numbers contain three pieces of information. The first letter indicates which section of the hall the room is in: Hayden, Monroe, or Wood (see the hall map). The number is the number of the room. The trailing letter indicates the size of the room; A's are the largest and D's are the smallest.<P>

If you click on the "Alum" field, the list will be displayed with
current residents first, followed by alumnae of the hall.<P>
