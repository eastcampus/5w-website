This database was developed in order to track who in our small living
group was paying for movie. As an added benefit (and this has now
become its primary purpose) it enables people to rank movies on a
scale of 1-10.

This is version 2 of the movie database. It is written in perl version
4, and runs correctly on linux boxes. The program consists of two
scripts, input.pl and domovie.pl. input.pl is an administration
script. it currently only inputs movies; it will be expanded to allow
changinga and removing movies. 

domovie.pl excecutes the html generation, and must be run in order to
update the web pages.

currently, the link _must_ be via web.mit.edu. for reasons i do not
understand, it doesnt work otherwise.
