Page</title>

<p> This is a perl-based movie database designed for a relatively small living
group. It tracks the movies we watch, who pays for movies, and who
leaves id behind. It also allows ratings to be input for each
movie. </p>

<p> The main database program is available <a href = "moviefoo.pl">
here. </a> It requires a text file which contains the actual
data. This file should be named moviefoo.txt, and must contain the
line "start" and the line "#:fakemovie:never:foobar" as the first two
lines. </p>

<p> The <a href ="input"> input </a> program contains a simple
manager program to add items to the database. You will need to
re-format it based on your local installation needs. </p>

<p> All of the above are available under the GNU Public Licence. </p>

<h2> You are the <img

visitor to this site.</h2>

<p> Note: Some things in this programs are not implemented
particularly well. Things that will be changed in version 2: </p>
<ul>
<li> Financial data will actually be calculated, not just averaged
out. If you watch an expensive movie, your expected cost should go up.
<li> Movie's should be listed by title and rating, with a list of
rankings from _anyone_ who has ever watched them. It should be
maintained seperatly from the financial database. 
<li> A list of movies, with dates, should also still be available for
reference. 
<li> A comprehensive admin tool, able to add/change ratings, add
movies, change movies, and enter comments. Some of this should be
cgi-ified; the rest should be on athena.
</ul>
