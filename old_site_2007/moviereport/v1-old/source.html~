<p> This is a perl-based movie database designed for a relatively small living
group. It tracks the movies we watch, who pays for movies, and who
leaves id behind. It also allows ratings to be input for each
movie. </p>

<p> The main database program is available <a href = "moviefoo.pl">
here. </a> It requires a text file which contains the actual
data. This file should be named moviefoo.txt, and must contain the
line "start" and the line "#:fakemovie:never:foobar" as the first two
lines. </p>

<p> The <a href ="input"> input </a> program contains a simple
manager program to add items to the database. You will need to
re-format it based on your local installation needs. </p>

<p> All of the above are available under the GNU Public Licence. </p>
